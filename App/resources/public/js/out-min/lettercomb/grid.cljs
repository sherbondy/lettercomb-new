;; non-mutating game board/grid code goes here
;; defines the storage format and means of converting
;; between different representations

;; define a board in terms of its top-left hexagon center
;; and the constituent columns and rows going down.
;; could compactly represent as a bit vector
;; max dims = 7 x 12 = 84 entries, 84 bits

;; grid terminology from
;; http://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#conversions

;; we store in *odd-r* representation
;; and use *axial/cube* conversions for convenience
;; in certain algorithms

;; probably want to represent as UInt8Array
;; @TODO: maybe we should redefine the board to be col, row
;; instead of row, col

;; maybe I should use logic programming
;; so I don't have to define inverse operations...

;; if we keep the grid as a vector, we gain the
;; advantage of structural sharing for the history
;; of a board, so replays become trivial!
